Tech/framework used

* Generate an auto-encoder that is able to take a collection of snips, encode them to a Z (latent space), and decode them back to similar snips.
* In that Latent space, locate all the elements of each myers brigs and generate 8 clusters.
* Later predict on Myers brigs based on which cluster a SNP collection belongs to.
