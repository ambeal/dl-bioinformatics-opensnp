    "Before we dig too deeply into the data we should understand the data format a little bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the OpenSNP  has 4 components each . A CSV file, several text files, several image files, and another CSV file corresponding to the image files. We will be ignoring the image data during this exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV file is delimitted by ';' and there are a number of rows, each corresponding to a question that a user answered. Each row corresponds to a different user. User's do not need to answer any question, in fact most of them do not. To add further complication, the answers are primarily free-form and not normalized to any standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each text file corresponds to a single user (and a single user may have more than 1 text file associated with them). The text files contain a list of genetic variants that were identified in the user's genetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The genetic variant information in this dataset was uploaded by users and collected and analyzed through various services such as [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/), [deCODEme](https://www.decode.com/decode-launches-decodeme/), or [FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com/) (the source is listed in the `.txt` files and the survey information was collected through [OpenSNP](https://www.opensnp.org/)"
